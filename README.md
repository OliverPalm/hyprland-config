# hyprland-config
### Included in this repo is:
1. Config file for [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/)
2. Config file for [Hyprpaper](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Hypr-Ecosystem/hyprpaper/) (and background images + script to load a random one)

### Not included is:
1. Config for waybar, that can be found [here](https://github.com/OliverPalm/waybar-config)

### General
I mostly like the default look of Hyprland so visualy not much is changed from a default download (aside from extras like waybar and hyprpaper). The major differences in my config is the bindings - the movement for both focus and the windows are based around vim keybinds, changing workspaces is done with 0-9 and tab, and (as one could suspect) there is a keybind for every program I use.

### Extra
Alot of the wallpapers come from here:
